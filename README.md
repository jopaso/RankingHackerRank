# RankingHackerRank
This pyhton3 code reads from a file called "Input.in" and creates a ranking for a programming contest.

You must paste all the submissions that have been made during a HackerRank contest in the Input.in file. Note that the submissions will be pasted leaving a blank line between each information.

After the execution 3 files will be created:
  - submissions.txt: This file contains all the correct submissions, showing the problem, team and time for each submission.
  - clasificaion.txt: This file contains the ranking with the sum of problems solved and time.
  - ranking.xlsx: This is an excel file that creates a table with the problems (you must write them manually in the method ini_excel) and the teams in order, showing the problems solved and the time they have been solved.
