# RankingHackerRank
This pyhton3 code reads from a file called "Input.in" where you must paste all the submissions that have been made during a HackerRank contest and creates the ranking in an Excel file marking the correct submissions. Note that the submissions will be pasted in the Input.in file leaving a blank line between every information.
